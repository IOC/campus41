# moodle-local_courseoverview

This local plugin adds information to every course in the dashboard about the number of unread post forums, pending assignments (to submit or to grade) and the pending quizzes (to respond or to grade, in case of essay questions).

The information is added in this format: the activity icon followed by a figure which is the number of pending content or activities. This information is provided inside the card, the list item or the summary box, depending on the selected visualization in the dashboard.

To install the plugin, download the files inside the folder local/courseoverview, go to _Site administration | Notifications_ and follow the standard steps.
